Rules:

Make sure you commit in the conventional commit style. This helps keep all commits organized and tidy

New features / bugfixes should go on their own branches. 

Do not commit to the releases branch! Github will block you anyway. You need to commit to your feature branch, then merge to master then I will merge to releases.
